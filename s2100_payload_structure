How an S2100 uplinks a payload:

-Notes:
*Frame Content is in Big-Endian Byte Order
*Excluding Battery Packets,
     Each "Measurement Packet" always contains 2 Measurements. If only 1 Measurement is populated with data, the second 
     measurement will have the value 0.
*When there are 4 Measurements, the first ID will be 0x30, the final will be 0x33. 
*0x32 is only used when Measurements > 4.

- 3 Types of Packets
    1 - 0x39 Battery Packet
    2 - 0x31 When Total Measurements are <= 2.
    3. When the number of Measurements >2, there are 3 "sub packets".
        1- First(0x30)
        2- Middle(0x32)
        3- Final(0x33)
